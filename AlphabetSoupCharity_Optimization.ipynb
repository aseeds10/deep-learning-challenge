This file format is considered legacy. We recommend using instead the native Keras format, e.g. `model.save('my_model.keras')` or `keras.saving.save_model(model, 'my_model.keras')`. \n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["\n","    async function download(id, filename, size) {\n","      if (!google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed) {\n","        return;\n","      }\n","      const div = document.createElement('div');\n","      const label = document.createElement('label');\n","      label.textContent = `Downloading \"${filename}\": `;\n","      div.appendChild(label);\n","      const progress = document.createElement('progress');\n","      progress.max = size;\n","      div.appendChild(progress);\n","      document.body.appendChild(div);\n","\n","      const buffers = [];\n","      let downloaded = 0;\n","\n","      const channel = await google.colab.kernel.comms.open(id);\n","      // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n","      channel.send({})\n","\n","      for await (const message of channel.messages) {\n","        // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n","        channel.send({})\n","        if (message.buffers) {\n","          for (const buffer of message.buffers) {\n","            buffers.push(buffer);\n","            downloaded += buffer.byteLength;\n","            progress.value = downloaded;\n","          }\n","        }\n","      }\n","      const blob = new Blob(buffers, {type: 'application/binary'});\n","      const a = document.createElement('a');\n","      a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n","      a.download = filename;\n","      div.appendChild(a);\n","      a.click();\n","      div.remove();\n","    }\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["download(\"download_56212169-ff42-4c51-9733-9cbfb568aa6a\", \"AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5\", 33192)"]},"metadata":{}}]}]}
